## 📖 **Overview**

This repository contains the IaC ([Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)) configuration for my homelab.

Most of my homelab runs on **Proxmox**, with VMs managed and maintained using [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/). All VMs are cloned from templates I created with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

All services are **containerized**, either managed with **Docker Compose** or **orchestrated with Kubernetes**. Over time, I've been migrating everything to Kubernetes using **[GitOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practices**, which is my long-term goal.

To automate infrastructure updates, I use **Github Actions**, which trigger workflows upon changes to this repo. This ensures seamless deployment and maintenance across my homelab:

- **[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/)** manages Continuous Deployment (CD) for Kubernetes, deployed via [Flux Operator](https://fluxcd.control-plane.io/).
- **[Docker CD Workflow](https://github.com/Mafyuh/iac/blob/main/.github/workflows/CD.yml)** handles Continuous Deployment for Docker services.
- **[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)** keeps services updated by opening PRs for new versions.
- **[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)** is used to execute playbooks on all of my VMs, automating management and configurations

### 🔒 **Security & Networking**

For Secret management I use [Bitwarden Secrets](https://bitwarden.com/products/secrets-manager/) and their various [integrations](https://bitwarden.com/help/ansible-integration/) into the tools used.

> Kubernetes is using External Secrets implementation of BWS, not official. BWS Access Key is SOPS encrypted.

**[GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/)** makes sure to alert me if I do accidentally push a secret

Each container image is automatically scanned by **[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/)**, with detected vulnerabilities published to **[Github Security](https://github.com/security)**

I use **Oracle Cloud** for their [Always-Free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) VM's and deploy Docker services that require uptime here. [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com/) is used to connect my home network to the various VPS's securely using [Zero Trust architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_architecture).

I use [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for my DNS provider with [**Cloudflare Tunnels**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) to expose some of the services to the world. [**Cloudflare Access**](https://www.cloudflare.com/access/) is used as Zero Trust for public websites, this is paired with [**Fail2Ban**](https://www.fail2ban.org/) looking through all my reverse proxy logs for malicious actors who made it through [**Access**](https://www.cloudflare.com/access/) and banning them via [**Cloudflare WAF**](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-application-firewall/).

I also utilize Unifi's IDS/IPS for intrusion detection on my home network, and use **[Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)** as a SIEM to monitor and generate security alerts across all my hosts.

### **📊 Monitoring & Observability**

I use a combination of **Grafana, Loki, Alloy, and Prometheus** with various exporters to collect and visualize system metrics, logs, and alerts. This helps maintain visibility into my infrastructure and detect issues proactively.

- **Prometheus** – Metrics collection and alerting
- **Loki** – Centralized logging for containers and VMs
- **Grafana** – Dashboarding and visualization
- **Exporters** – Alloy, Blackbox Exporter, Speedtest Exporter, etc.

### ☁️ **Cloud Dependencies**

Although I try to self-host everything I can, my infra still relies on the cloud for certain services.

## 🧑‍💻 **Getting Started**

This repo is not structured like a project you can easily replicate. Although if you are new to any of the tools used I encourage you to read through the directories that make up each tool to see how I am using them.

Over time I will try to add more detailed instructions in each directories README.

Some good references for how I learned this stuff (other than RTFM)

## 🖥️ **Hardware**

Proof that you don't need expensive new equipment to run infra like mine. Mostly everything here is secondhand, bought over time, totaling less than ~$3k.
